AW) *Grunt* Where am I? What happened? Where is everyone?
AW) McGregor! Fredrickson! Ashton! Is anyone here?
AW) Where is everyone? What in the devil is this?
AW) Duvall's necklace? Wesley's glasses? They're bloody.
AW) These are scratch marks and bits of... fingernail. My god.
AW) I need to get out of here. Now.
AW) The door's locked and I can't see a key. Maybe I can pick the lock.
AW) I bet that door's locked, too. I'm gonna need to find the key for it.
AW) The main door's locked. There's no way I'll be able to batter it open.
AW) I'll need to hunt for the key to get out of here, before whatever...
AW) took the others comes for me now that I'm out.
AW) That might be my only chance. I need to find a way to...
AW) unscrew that grating. And quickly, I've only got about... 
AW) 30 seconds, probably.
AW) I rather doubt that thing will be able to fit in that tiny vent. 
AW) What is this place? I better look around.
AW) Alright, it looks like I'll have to search this place for the...
AW) main door's key if I want to get out of here alive. If this... 
AW) really is the key to the kitchen, I'd better start there. 
AW) Hmm. If I can find something hard enough to knock the handle off... 
AW) I can get to the key. I should look around to see if I can... 
AW) find something to use. Maybe that freezer will help somehow.
AW) That won't hold for more than a few minutes. I need to hurry...
AW) and find a way out of here if I've any hope of surviving.
AW) So one secret room leads to another. At least I have an exit...
AW) to both floors now.
AW) Of course it's locked, it would be too easy otherwise. 
AW) Well, one of the hinges is rusted pretty badly. 
AW) Maybe I can do something to bust the door open.
AW) That bedpost looks big enough and loose enough to work.
AW) *Sniff* What's that queer smell? *Sniff* Almonds?... 
AW) Almonds! CYANIDE! My god! There's no valve, I need to block those... 
AW) vents so I can find the key and get out. And soon, I've only got...
AW) two minutes at the most.
AW) If that thing hears me, I'm dead. I need to distract it somehow so I... 
AW) can slip by. Though I need to avoid that glass... 
AW) I bet I'll make a racket if I step on it.
AW) *Cough* Oh god, more gas. It must have backed up in the vents...
AW) I bet the entire house is flooded with the stuff. 
AW) I *Cough* need to find a way to shut that valve off once and for all. 
AW) But I'll also need to clear this place out. *Cough* If I can break all of...
AW) the windows, I can get some fresh air in here, maybe buy myself some time. 
AW) But I need to get into that boiler room the journal mentioned and shut...
AW) that thing off. However I do this*Cough*, I need to hurry. 
AW) I've probably only got five minutes at the most. *Cough*
AW)	YES, AT LAST!  How do I get out, though? That's the only exit and it's...
AW) too high to jump. Hmm. If I can't hurt that thing, then maybe a grand...
AW) piano can. How am I to leverage that behemoth though? 
AW) *Panting* I'm out. It's over. Ha ha, it's over.
