NightWatch
==========

A game I made in Freshman Year (February 2013 - May 2013) with four other people.

The game NightWatch was a student-made project for the class Game Software Development III. The game was designed as a 
top-down mystery/puzzle game wherein a player navigates through a mansion to try and escape, all the while being chased by 
a monster. In addition, we had intended to implement multiple endings for the game. The game was intended to be vastly 
different from what was to be expected from a ten-week Freshman-made game by focusing on story, atmosphere, puzzles, and 
tension as opposed to basic mechanics and simple gameplay.

Though we received an A on the assignment, the game was largely incomplete at the time of submission. When the due-date 
came around, roughly half of what we had initially intended to deliver was implemented. Most of our puzzles had not been 
implemented, we had no ending let alone two, and we had no monster mechanic yet. We had basic user controllability, 
collisions, a map-editor, the story and dialog, most of the art and some animations, and room-to-room navigation completed.
We had enough to call it a basic game and little else.

However, I still count this game as one of the most important projects Iâ€™ve done and one of the greatest learning 
experiences of my time in college. NightWatch taught me how to make a game, not just how to program or design one. I 
learned a stern lesson in controlling the scope of your game and the dangers of well-intentioned but practically unviable 
design choices. While professors had touched upon this in class, nothing really home the point home like actually creating 
a game and seeing the effects of poor design choices. For every game, both digital and analog, I have worked on since 
NightWatch, I have always looked back on it and made sure that I utilize what I learned from its development. Since then, 
my games have not had serious problems with scope-creep (obviously a small amount is to be expected from every project, but
nothing significant).Less dramatically but still as important, during the design, I wrote the entire script for the game as
well as writing and implementing the dialog to appear on screen, both of which I am proud of for being generally decent and, 
in the case of the dialog boxes, functional.
